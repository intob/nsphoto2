Born in 1987, in a small town in Switzerland, I grew up hiking in the Swiss alps. Going on camping trips with my family and being outdoors, adventure was always part of my life.

After 9 years of school, I did an apprenticeship as a drafts woman, a school for interior design, and then worked as a construction manager. During that time I traveled a lot on my own, with friends and my family.

My father always took pictures and made family films, so it came that I wanted to do the same. I started with photography around year 2008, and it has become increasingly important in my life. I quit my job in 2016 to work as a freelance photographer and filmmaker, and I love it!

Now finally, after many years, my business is growing fast. I get more enquiries for great projects than I can handle. The future for my photography & filmmaking looks very bright.
