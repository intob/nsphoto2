My Nikkon Z7 II makes incredible photos, but I can also shoot stable, 4k video with very good dynamic range. You will be surprised by what is possible.

This approach is particularly effective for expeditions & adventures where gear weight is limited, access is challenging & time is short.

I have been doing this with Swiss Tourism, and they are very happy with the results.
